# Identifying the Best Next Studies Based on Design Efficiency

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


### Description

This application takes the meta-analysis data studying the association between two focal constructs and returns the design characteristics of a set of best next studies which when done sequentially will improve the efficiency of the literature.

### Data Input Needed

You can upload your data and the number of next studies you want to calculate in the web application below and get the design characteristics of the studies and corresponding A- and D-efficiency by sequentially adding these studies.

The data should have the following characteristics

   - be a `.csv` file
   - have a column specifying the year of the studies ("Year" in the sample data)
   - have a column specifying the correlation of the association being studied ("Corr" in the sample data)
   - all other columns in the data should be the study design factors

***Sample Data***

You can check the desired data structure and also test the functionality of the application using sample data available to download [***here***](data/Efficiency_Best_Next_Studies_Sample_Data_081522.csv){target="_blank"}.

You need to identify the names of the `year` variable, which is "Year" in the sample data, and `correlation` variable,which is "Corr" in the sample data, in your data in the web application below.

***Note***

    - Given the computational complexity of this analysis, the code will take some time to compile.
